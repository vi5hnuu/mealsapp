This app is not fully functional...it is for understanding difference between..

There are two version file
1. Master branch have code that shows how flutter provide default tabs widget
2.Version2 brach has code that show how we can create tabs at bottom of scrren instead of at the top of screen + it shows how time consuming and unecessary repaint will
happen if we use setState=>liting state up in big brojects...
